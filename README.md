# whirlpool-fpga-miner
Implementation Of A FPGA Miner Using The Whirlpool Hashing Algorithm


The Master version is configured for the LOGI Pi FPGA pins using a Spartan9 chip.
To build this version, you will need at least 60K LUTs (such as an LX150 board)

2 Branches have been created
  - Branch 1 For the LX9 chip
  - Branch 2 For chips between the LX9 and LX150 that use a paramater to adjust the area
