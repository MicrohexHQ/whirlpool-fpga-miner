Implementation Of A FPGA Miner Using The Whirlpool Hashing Algorithm

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I will no longer be posting any fpga code; however, I have left this LX9 implementation for any fpga developers that want to get a feel for how you could implement the whirlpool algo on a small fpga.

Below are the final updates I am providing for the ZTEX 15y1 Quad Board.  I will not be providing any support for this implementation so use at your own risk...I have been advised that this bitstream does not work (although it provides ~700mh/s on my ZTEX).

To run this bitstream, you will need to use a modified version of cgminer 3.1.1

To build cgminer yourself, follow the ReadMe.txt instructions in zip file at the following location:

I have also provided the cgminer binaries I build on a Windows 7 64 bit PC.  This may not work on other versions of Windows and may not work if you don't have the correct drivers installed.  To install, follow the ReadMe.txt instructions in zip file at the following location:
